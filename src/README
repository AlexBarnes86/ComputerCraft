Objective: to create a swarm of turtles that are capable of gathering a variety of resources and building in a modularized fashion while communicating with a central command server

Any coordinate can be defined as a path node and inserted into the server for pathfinding

Different Zone Types:
* Safe Zone: Turtles must not modify blocks in these regions
* Dock: Special safe zone that is intended for a turtle to return to when not in use
* Quary: Heavy resource extraction, every block in a defined region is intended for potential extraction and storage
* Stockpile: Region intended to be converted into hallways of chests for various resources, each chest dedicated to a particular resource and indexed for retrieval and storage
	Shape of hallway:

            |-------------------|
            |c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|
            |c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|
entrance>                       |  ...
walkway<>                       |
  exit<                         |
            --------------------|

	Signs should be placed above chests to indicate contents
	Layer depicted should sit ontop of a stone floor, the layer above should be empty except for walls to make headroom, and the layer above that should be a stone ceiling

	Indexed by floor, 

Others zones to be defined later

Each zone will consist of
	Start Coordinate
	End Coordinate

	Entrance Node
	Exit Node

	Optional graph of path nodes

For travel between nodes:
	1) Navigate to exit node (if currently inside of a zone)
	2) Go up into the sky at height proportional to distance needed to travel
	3) Navigate to entrance node then descend to entrance node
	4) Use graph of path nodes to navigate further if necessary
